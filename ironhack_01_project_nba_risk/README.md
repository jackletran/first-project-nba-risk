# Description

OOP game built with web technologies (html, css, javascript)

# How to play

Move player with arrow keys :)

# Demo

@todo :)

# Further Improvements:

Fix:

- [ ] prevent player from going outside
- [ ] avoid repeating code for Player and Obstacle class (inheritance)

Functionality:

- shooting (recommended)
- drop different things (prizes, different types of obstacles...)
- count points
- improve game over
- levels (ex. increasing speed as user moves to the next level)
- multiple lives
- allow moving the player up and down
- settings (speed of the game, distance between obstacles)

UX:

- add images (background, player, obstacles...)
- sound

Code quality:

- apply OOP inheritance
- detach logic & DOM manipulation
